## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to add maps to a website and how to search for any IP address or retrieve my own IP address using Ipify. Projects like these have become easier for me, and I was able to complete this one within just a few hours.


### Continued development

I want to learn how to get the location from a map when clicking on it. I also want to learn how to select two locations and display the path between them with a colored outline. Additionally, I would like to learn how to add notes to a selected location.
